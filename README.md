# LaMetric app - AVT price display

A simple app to push updates of the price of the ERC20 AVT token using AWS Lambdas.

## Set up

* copy this code in a Lambda
* update the code with your app id and app token (given you create your push app)
* trigger it with a _cron_ (CloudWatch Events)
* install the app on your LaMetric
* enjoy!

## Go further!

The script can be changed to handle other cryptos. 
The code is probably going to evolve a bit, stay in touch!
If you have some improvements in mind, post a pull request or submit an issue :)
